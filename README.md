This repository is for testing synchronization between a Google Drive folder and a folder within a Git repo.  
The main purpose is to establish a more robust version control when working with Google Colab notebooks.  
Google Drive is the preferred hosting while the development is active, as it autosaves the notebook.  
However, once ready to commit, one needs to save to GitHub manually by choosing the appropriate repo and typing the path to the notebook, which is very error-prone.  
This repo explores strategies for more automated synchronization between Google Drive and local git / GitHub.
